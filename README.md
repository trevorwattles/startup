### Elevator pitch

### Design
![image0 (6)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd824a43-965c-4660-949a-42073ab0a92a)

The design of the Random Joke Generator revolves around simplicity and user interactivity, as illustrated in the sequence diagram. The application begins with the user fetching a random joke, which the backend retrieves from an external API and delivers to the user interface. A "Save to Favorites" button allows users to save a joke they enjoy, sending a request to the backend to store the joke in a database tied to their account. Once saved, the server confirms the action and broadcasts the updated favorite list to all connected clients in real time using WebSocket technology. This ensures that the user's saved jokes are accessible across devices and visible to others instantly. The design incorporates separate pages for login, joke display, and favorites, leveraging React components and routing to create a dynamic and responsive user experience.

## ðŸš€ CSS deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **Header, footer, and main content body** - I made the header and footer full-width with a dark background, fixed the header at the top with a shadow, and centered the main content vertically with padding to avoid overlap with the fixed header.
- [x] **Navigation elements** - I styled the navigation elements by using a `<menu>` inside `<nav>`, making it a flex container centered with evenly spaced items, and giving the links a bold, yellow color that changes to orange with an underline on hover. However, note that `<menu>` is not the typical element used for navigation; `<ul>` is more common.

- [x] **Responsive to window resizing** - The header and footer span the full width of the viewport, while the main content remains centered using display: flex and min-height: 80vh to adjust with varying screen heights. The form and input fields use max-width: 400px and width: 100%, making them responsive while maintaining a structured layout. Additionally, using gap and padding for spacing ensures elements remain visually balanced across different screen sizes.
- [x] **Application elements** - I designed interactive components like a joke generator with dynamically updating text, a save joke button that appears conditionally, and a personalized welcome message extracted from the URL parameters. Additionally, the navigation menu, notifications, and structured layout ensure a user-friendly experience, while smooth animations and transitions enhance interactivity and responsiveness.
- [x] **Application text content** - I used application text content dynamically by displaying a personalized welcome message based on the URL parameters and updating the joke text upon button clicks. Additionally, you included pre-saved jokes from other users as part of the UI, reinforcing user interaction and engagement with meaningful and context-aware content.
- [x] **Application images** - I incorporated application images by including a favicon (favicon.ico) in the `<head>` section, which helps with branding and recognition in browser tabs. I also included an image in the about section with a feded gray border, the overall design relies on structured text and styled elements to create a visually engaging experience without requiring additional graphics.
