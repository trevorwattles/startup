### Design
![image0 (6)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd824a43-965c-4660-949a-42073ab0a92a)

The design of the Random Joke Generator revolves around simplicity and user interactivity, as illustrated in the sequence diagram. The application begins with the user fetching a random joke, which the backend retrieves from an external API and delivers to the user interface. A "Save to Favorites" button allows users to save a joke they enjoy, sending a request to the backend to store the joke in a database tied to their account. Once saved, the server confirms the action and broadcasts the updated favorite list to all connected clients in real time using WebSocket technology. This ensures that the user's saved jokes are accessible across devices and visible to others instantly. The design incorporates separate pages for login, joke display, and favorites, leveraging React components and routing to create a dynamic and responsive user experience.
